To whoever trying to do some more research on UNet and UNet++,

At the start of my research, I did not think the project will be this complex. Understanding skip connection and nested skip pathway of UNet and UNet++ was the easy part, but waiting for me was 1 month of finding data and understanding them, another month to implement the models (it was easy, BUT i have limited resources so i have to reduce the size of the models, took a while for me to find out why cuda keep running out of memory). There was a lot of problems while (maybe beacause i use light mode) finding and processing the data. Since I have experience in dealing with data, I thought this one would be the easy part, but NO=)). The enormous amout of python scripts in this repo will tell you that. I did not think there will be this much preprocessing so i did not document what script do what. 

Regardless, every python script here serve some purpose to my thesis. it is just that now only God know which file do what. So if you ever want to replicate my research, feel free. But mind yourself that if you have any question about this repo, dont mail me since i dont know also.

God bless,
